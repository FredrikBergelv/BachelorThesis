It reviews the progress made towards meeting the air quality standards established in the two EU Ambient Air Quality Directives and towards the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines (AQGs). It also presents the latest findings and estimates of population and ecosystem exposure to the air pollutants with the greatest impacts. The evaluation of the status of air quality is based mainly on reported ambient air measurements, in conjunction with modelling data and data on anthropogenic emissions and the trends they exhibit over time. The Air quality in Europe report is only possible thanks to countries' official reporting of data. We would like to recognise and acknowledge the support from the air quality experts in the reporting countries.},

  abstract = {A study of particulate matter and temperature in the atmosphere in several places in Chile has been carried out in three different years with the objective of determining a common pattern of the influence of thermal inversions on PM2.5 and black carbon. Temperature measurements were used to separate days with and without inversions. In all sites it was found that the days with thermal inversions had higher black carbon or PM2.5 than days without inversions. In the rural site, black carbon was 57\% higher during inversion days. In the downtown Santiago site the PM2.5 was 35\% higher during inversion days. At the western Santiago site it was possible to separate the days into three categories; only surface, surface and subsidence, and no thermal inversion. In days with both types of inversion, PM2.5 was 84\% higher than days without any type of inversion. During days with only surface inversion, PM2.5 was higher only during the morning and the average PM2.5 was only 14\% higher. Although during inversion days the concentrations were higher, it was not possible to find a significant correlation between the strength or intensity of the inversion with black carbon or PM2.5 in the sites without temperature measurements as function of height. However, when this data is available, a moderate correlation is found, indicating that the complete vertical temperature profile is needed in order to find a relationship between those variables.},

  abstract = {Air pollutants such as NO2 and PM2.5 have consistently been linked to mortality, but only few previous studies have addressed associations with long-term exposure to black carbon (BC) and ozone (O3). We investigated the association between PM2.5, PM10, BC, NO2, and O3 and mortality in a Danish cohort of 49,564 individuals who were followed up from enrollment in 1993--1997 through 2015. Residential address history from 1979 onwards was combined with air pollution exposure obtained by the state-of-the-art, validated, THOR/AirGIS air pollution modelling system, and information on residential traffic noise exposure, lifestyle and socio-demography. We observed higher risks of all-cause as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality with higher long-term exposure to PM2.5, PM10, BC, and NO2. For PM2.5 and CVD mortality, a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.29 (95\% CI: 1.13--1.47) per 5\,{$\mu$}g/m3 was observed, and correspondingly HRs of 1.16 (95\% CI: 1.05--1.27) and 1.11 (95\% CI: 1.04--1.17) were observed for BC (per 1\,{$\mu$}g/m3) and NO2 (per 10\,{$\mu$}g/m3), respectively. Adjustment for noise gave slightly lower estimates for the air pollutants and CVD mortality. Inverse relationships were observed for O3. None of the investigated air pollutants were related to risk of respiratory mortality. Stratified analyses suggested that the elevated risks of CVD and all-cause mortality in relation to long-term PM, NO2 and BC exposure were restricted to males. This study supports a role of PM, BC, and NO2 in all-cause and CVD mortality independent of road traffic noise exposure.},
