\subsection{The measuring devices}
\subsubsection{The meteorological measuring devices}
The wind data from both Hörby and Helsingborg used the high-performance wind sensor Vaisala WAA15A for the wind speed and Vaisala WAV15A for the wind direction. These instruments were serviced and calibrated every year or every other year, and had been in use since 1995. The WAA15A anemometer measured wind speed with an accuracy of $\pm\SI{0.17}{\m\per\s}$, and the WAV15A wind vane measured the wind direction with an accuracy better than $\pm\ang{3}$ \cite{vaisalaWindSetWA152021}. The WAA15A anemometer works by a rotating chopper disc that interrupts an infrared beam, resulting in a laser pulse proportional to the wind speed. The WAV15A wind vane uses a counterbalanced vane with an optical disc. When the vane turns, infrared LEDs detect the change in angle with the disc and phototransistors, resulting in a precise measurement of the wind angle. For rain monitoring, the Geonor T200 device had been in use for all stations since 1995. Like the wind monitor, this device had been serviced and calibrated every year or every other year. This device works by measuring precipitation with a vibrating wire sensor that detects weight changes from the water droplets\cite{geonorinc.T200BSeriesAll2019}. The device has a measurement accuracy better than \SI{0.1}{\mm}. The rain measurements in Tånga was measured manually by a beaker located on a field. Thus, errors in this measurement were higher than the digital measurement devices . 

The barometer that has been in use for Helsingborg is a Vaisala PTB201A for the entire period, except for the periods from April 15, 2015, to April 17, 2025, and from September 19, 2004, to May 23, 2014, when a Vaisala PTB220 was used instead. Even then, the device has been serviced every year or every other year. The PTB201A digital barometer operates using a silicon capacitive absolute pressure sensor, providing stable and accurate pressure values \cite{vaisalaPTB200DIGITAL1993}. The sensor functions by means of a flexed diaphragm inside a capacitor that bends in response to air pressure, causing a change in the capacitor’s distance and thus a variation in the current. This device measures pressure in the range of \SI{600}{\hecto\pascal} to \SI{1100}{\hecto\pascal}, with an accuracy of $\pm\SI{0.3}{\hecto\pascal}$. Errors in the device may arise due to environmental factors, such as exposure to condensing gases. The Vaisala PTB220 digital barometer operates in a similar manner but offers a wider measurement range of \SI{500}{\hecto\pascal} to \SI{1100}{\hecto\pascal}, with an improved accuracy of $\pm\SI{0.15}{\hecto\pascal}$ \cite{vaisalaPTB220SeriesDigital2001}.

\subsubsection{The \texorpdfstring{\PM }{PM2.5} measuring devices}
The measurement device used at Vavihill was the ambient particulate monitor TEOM 1400. This monitor continuously collects airborne particles less then \SI{2.5}{\micro\g} onto a filter and measures their mass using an oscillating microbalance technique \cite{thermofisherscientificinc.TEOMSeries1400a2007}. The oscillating microbalance works by vibrating at a natural frequency, which changes as particles accumulate on the filter. Since this frequency shift is proportional to the mass of the deposited particles, their total mass can be accurately determined. The precision of the monitor was $\pm\SI{1.5}{\micro\gram\per\meter\cubed}$. Thus, the monitor provides high precision and stable measurements. However, a key limitation is that it cannot distinguish between different types of particles, as it only measures total mass.

When the measuring station was moved to Hallahus, the measuring device was updated to the fine dust analysis system Palas FIDAS 200. This device works by an optical aerosol spectrometer which samples particles from an isokinetic inlet through a polychromatic light-scattering channel where the scattering angles and intensity were measured. \cite{palasgmbhOperatingManualFidas}. This results in a high accuracy of $\pm\SI{0.1}{\micro\gram\per\meter\cubed}$, indicating an improvement from the other device. 

The monitoring station in Malmö used several measuring devices over time, in conjunction with other equipment. Between the start of the monitoring and January 1, 2009, the TEOM 1400 monitor was used. From January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2015, the TEOM 1400, FDMS, and 8500 B or CB dryer were employed. Between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2021, the TEOM 1405F and FDMS systems, along with the 8500 B, were in use. Finally, from January 1, 2022, the Palas FIDAS 200 monitor replaced the earlier systems. The FDMS (Filter Dynamics Measurement System) is a dynamic filter measurement system that enhances measurements by accounting for volatile and semi-volatile particles \cite{thermoscientific8500FDMSFilter2010}. The CB dryer and 8500 B were air dryers used to prevent moisture from entering the measurement devices, ensuring accurate data by avoiding potential interference caused by water vapour.






\subsubsection{The Meteorological Data and Measurements}
The meteorological data which was used in this project can be observed in \autoref{table:stations}. The choice of atmospheric pressure measurement station was Helsingborg, located \SI{25}{\km} from Vavihill and \SI{49}{\km} from Malmö. This location was chosen based on its proximity to both \PM measuring stations, the fact that neither Malmö nor Vavihill have pressure measurements from this period, and the fact that the station has been in use from August 2, 1995, with measurements taken every hour without any missing values. The period used for this station was from start until October 10, 2024. This station thus covers the entire period of the \PM data. Although the data was measured at a certain altitude, the data was provided as recalculated sea-level pressure. 

The barometer that has been in use for Helsingborg is a Vaisala PTB201A for the entire period, except for the periods from April 15, 2015, to April 17, 2025, and from September 19, 2004, to May 23, 2014, when a Vaisala PTB220 was used instead. The device has been serviced every year or every other year. The PTB201A digital barometer operates using a silicon capacitive absolute pressure sensor, providing stable and accurate pressure values \cite{vaisalaPTB200DIGITAL1993}. The sensor functions by means of a flexed diaphragm inside a capacitor that bends in response to air pressure, causing a change in the capacitor's distance and thus a variation in the current. This device measures pressure in the range of \SI{600}{\hecto\pascal} to \SI{1100}{\hecto\pascal}, with an accuracy of $\pm\SI{0.3}{\hecto\pascal}$. Errors in the device may arise due to environmental factors, such as exposure to condensing gases. The Vaisala PTB220 digital barometer operates in a similar manner but offers a wider measurement range of \SI{500}{\hecto\pascal} to \SI{1100}{\hecto\pascal}, with an improved accuracy of $\pm\SI{0.15}{\hecto\pascal}$ \cite{vaisalaPTB220SeriesDigital2001}.

The relevant rain and wind data were gathered from two different stations. For Vavihill, the station at Hörby, located \SI{35}{\km} away, was used, and for Malmö, a weather station just \SI{6}{\km} away was used. The weather station at Hörby was chosen instead of Helsingborg since neither Vavihill nor Hörby are located along the coast, whereas Helsingborg is. Coastal regions can experience a daily cycle of sea breezes and land breezes, which alter the wind direction. The wind and rain data from Hörby were measured from August 1, 1995, to October 1, 2020, with measurements taken every hour without any missing values. The Hörby station was temporarily relocated for a short period in 2021. The rain data from Malmö was measured from November 21, 1995, and the wind data from January 1, 1990, with both measurements ending on December 31, 2020. These stations did not lack any data.

The wind data from both Hörby and Helsingborg used the high-performance wind sensor Vaisala WAA15A for the wind speed and Vaisala WAV15A for the wind direction. These instruments were serviced and calibrated every year or every other year, and had been in use since 1995. The WAA15A anemometer measured wind speed with an accuracy of $\pm\SI{0.17}{\m\per\s}$, and the WAV15A wind vane measured the wind direction with an accuracy better than $\pm\ang{3}$ \cite{vaisalaWindSetWA152021}. The WAA15A anemometer works by a rotating chopper disc that interrupts an infrared beam, resulting in a laser pulse proportional to the wind speed. The WAV15A wind vane uses a counterbalanced vane with an optical disc. When the vane turns, infrared LEDs detect the change in angle with the disc and phototransistors, resulting in a precise measurement of the wind angle. For rain monitoring, the Geonor T200 device had been in use for all stations since 1995. Like the wind monitor, this device had been serviced and calibrated every year or every other year. This device works by measuring precipitation with a vibrating wire sensor that detects weight changes from the water droplets \cite{geonorinc.T200BSeriesAll2019}. The device has a measurement accuracy better than $\pm\SI{0.1}{\mm}$. 

The final task of this study was to evaluate if high-pressure blocking events had become increasingly more common. For this evaluation, atmospheric pressure data from Ängelholm airport was used instead of Helsingborg due to the pressure data from Ängelholm being active from January 5, 1946, meaning it has been in service for 49 years longer than that from Helsingborg. The data period used was from start until October 1, 2024. This station is located \SI{44}{\km} from Vavihill and \SI{76}{\km} from Malmö. However, the pressure values differed only by a mean of \SI{0.25}{\hecto\pascal} and a standard deviation of \SI{0.20}{\hecto\pascal} between December 1, 1995 to October 1 2024. The rain data was also expanded by using daily rain data from Ängelholm since this data was gathered from January 18, 1947, to November 30, 2001. To obtain the maximum amount of the rain data the data from Ängelholm was used together with the nearby station of Tånga. This station is located \SI{12}{\km} away and had been in use since December 19, 1973. For this station the period used was from start until August 31, 2024 with daily rain data. The rain measurements in Tånga was measured manually by a beaker located on a field. Thus, errors in this measurement were higher than the digital measurement devices.
