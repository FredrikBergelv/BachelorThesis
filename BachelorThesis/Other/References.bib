It reviews the progress made towards meeting the air quality standards established in the two EU Ambient Air Quality Directives and towards the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines (AQGs). It also presents the latest findings and estimates of population and ecosystem exposure to the air pollutants with the greatest impacts. The evaluation of the status of air quality is based mainly on reported ambient air measurements, in conjunction with modelling data and data on anthropogenic emissions and the trends they exhibit over time. The Air quality in Europe report is only possible thanks to countries' official reporting of data. We would like to recognise and acknowledge the support from the air quality experts in the reporting countries.},
