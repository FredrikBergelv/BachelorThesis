\section{Conclusion}
This thesis has demonstrated that the presence of high-pressure blocking events in southern Sweden significantly increased the aerosol concentration in both rural and urban locations. The \PM mean increase in Malmö went from \SI{10}{\micro\gram\per\meter\cubed} to a maximum of \SI{21}{\micro\gram\per\meter\cubed} during the high-pressure blocking period, and an increase from \SI{7}{\micro\gram\per\meter\cubed} to a maximum of \SI{18}{\micro\gram\per\meter\cubed} could be observed in Vavihill. Increased levels of \PM were seen in both locations after eight to thirteen days of uninterrupted high-pressure blocking, indicating accumulation of aerosols during the events. This accumulation was mainly attributed to the presence of a subsidence inversion layer, which prohibited vertical air mixing. A stronger increase was found in the urban area of Malmö than the rural area of Vavihill, which was mainly attributed to local emissions. The wind directional dependence on \PM concentrations indicated that the long-range advection of aerosols was a significant contributor to aerosol concentration in the region, where winds from central and eastern Europe significantly increased the aerosol levels, whereas winds from the northeast did not affect the concentrations. The seasonal dependence indicated an increase during the winter, which supports the idea of local emissions affecting the aerosol concentration. A stronger increase was also observed with stronger high-pressure blocking events, where the highest levels of \PM could be observed. Observing the lengths and number of high-pressure blocking events showed that there has not been an increase of any sort during the last 74 years, which differs from other European studies on nearby regions.
