\section{Method}
The relevant data was downloaded from the SMHI:s website as csv files. These files included hourly pressure data, hourly rain data, hourly wind data and hourly temperature data. Data of hourly PM\textsubscript{2.5} measured for one hour was also downloaded. The choice of locations had to be done by taking into account the location of the PM\textsubscript{2.5} stations and the time the stations had been active for.  

Mann-Kendall Test 

The deviation between the towns Sturup, Ã„ngelholm and Helsingborg was analysed to give insight into the different choices between these locations. The different in atmospheric pressure between these three had a mean of \SI{0.5}{\hecto\pascal} with a standard deviation of \SI{0.5}{\hecto\pascal}.
