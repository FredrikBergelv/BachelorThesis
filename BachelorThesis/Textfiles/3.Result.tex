\section{Result}

\subsection{Task 1 }
The first part of the goals mentioned above has been achieved using Pandas in Python by extracting periods of high-pressure blocking based on a pressure limit and a rainfall limit. The pressure limit was chosen to be \SI{1015}{\hecto\pascal}, meaning that a high-pressure blocking event must maintain at least \SI{1015}{\hecto\pascal} throughout the entire period. The rainfall limit was set to \SI{0.5}{\milli\meter}, meaning the period can have a maximum of \SI{0.5}{\milli\meter} rainfall during the entire period. The minimum period length was set to 5 days. The result during the year 2001 can be seen in \autoref{fig:2001}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Task 2}
The second task was to evaluate the PM\textsubscript{2.5} concentrations during periods of high pressure blocking using statistics. This was done by taking the mean of all the different blockings displaying this together with the standard deviation. This can be seen in \autoref{fig:Meanplot_Comparison}. The data is compared with the overall mean taken from the data. A slight increase in the normal concentrations of PM\textsubscript{2.5} can be seen in Malmö, while the same is hard to say about Vavihill.

\autoref{fig:PM25_wind_direction} shows the increase in PM\textsubscript{2.5} concentrations in vavihill and Malmö for different wind directions. Even though the Concentration increased more in Malmö than in Vavihill, the directional dependence is less prominent.This may suggest that the accumulation of PM\textsubscript{2.5} in Malmö may be due to the local emissions in Malmö being much greater than those in Vavihill, while the increase of PM\textsubscript{2.5} in Vavihill may be more to the aerosols being transported to the area via the anticyclonic winds.

\subsection{Task 3}
The last task was to determine if the number of days under high-pressure blockings has increased, in \autoref{fig:histograms}, it can be seen that this is not the case. The seasonal dependency was also accounted for, which can be observed in the plots.

\end{figure}
One can in \autoref{fig:blockings} see that the number of events with high pressure blocking per year has also not increased.
