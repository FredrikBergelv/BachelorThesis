\subsection{The evolution of \texorpdfstring{PM\textsubscript{2.5}}{PM2.5} over time}

After applying the high-pressure blocking detection method to the data from Vavihill for the entire period, a total of 298 high-pressure blocking events were identified between August 1, 1995, and October 10, 2024. Of these 298 events, 171 were removed due to insufficient PM\textsubscript{2.5} data, as a filter requiring 95\% data coverage was applied. This left 127 relevant high-pressure blocking events. For Malmö, a total of 299 high-pressure blocking events were identified between November 20, 1995, and October 1, 2024. From these, 99 events were removed due to insufficient PM\textsubscript{2.5} data, again applying the 95\% data coverage filter. This resulted in 200 relevant high-pressure blocking events. The result from the Mann-Kendall test can be viewed in the figures below. All of the categories had a p-value approximately equal to 0. An example plot showing the periods of high-pressure blocking events can be seen in \autoref{fig:2001}.

\end{figure}

The next result was to evaluate the PM\textsubscript{2.5} concentrations during periods of high-pressure blocking by taking the mean concentration from the start of the event. This can be seen in \autoref{fig:Meanplot_Comparison}. The data is compared with the PM\textsubscript{2.5} mean taken from periods without high-pressure blocking events. An increase in PM\textsubscript{2.5} concentrations can be seen in Malmö, while a slight increase can be observed in Vavihill. This is supported by the large $\tau$-value in the case of Malmö, and slight lower in Vavihill. The Sen's slope values also indicate a stronger increase in Malmö. It is important to note that after the first five days, the number of datasets decreases, which is reflected in the increase in standard deviation.

\subsubsection{The evolution of \texorpdfstring{PM\textsubscript{2.5}}{PM2.5} depending on wind direction}
The change in PM\textsubscript{2.5} concentrations in Vavihill and Malmö for different wind directions can be seen in \autoref{fig:Meanplot_wind}. One can see similarities between the wind directions for Vavihill and Malmö, although the extremes are more pronounced in Malmö. When the wind filter was applied for the Northeast direction (310° to 70°), no strong increase or high levels of PM\textsubscript{2.5} were detected, as supported by the $\tau$-values being under 0.5. The same is true for the Southeast direction (70° to 190°) and almost true for the non-specific wind direction, in Vavihill. However one must note in the case of Southeast direction (70° to 190°) for Vavihill that there is a clear increase until day 9, where the levels suddenly drop. For the other directions, an increase in PM\textsubscript{2.5} can be seen as supported by the $\tau$-values and Sen's slopes. Elevated levels can also be seen in Malmö for the West direction (190° to 310°), and especially in Vavihill for the SE direction (70° to 190°) where the mean concentration exceeds the EU annual mean limit.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Meanplot_dir.pdf}
    \caption{These plots show how PM\textsubscript{2.5} concentrations change in Vavihill and Malmö for different wind directions. In the case of Vavihill, it is important to note that 6.3\% of the winds came from the Northeast (310° to 70°), 39.9\% from the Southeast (70° to 190°), 21.3\% from the West (190° to 310°) and 42.5\% from no specific direction. In the case of Malmö, it is important to note that 7.5\% of the winds came from the Northeast (310° to 70°), 24.0\% from the Southeast (70° to 190°), 18.5\% from the West (190° to 310°) and 50.0\% from no specific direction. Note that a minimum number of datasets was still put to 8, resulting in some directions having very little data.}

\subsubsection{The evolution of \texorpdfstring{PM\textsubscript{2.5}}{PM2.5} depending on season}
The seasonal change in concentrations of PM\textsubscript{2.5} can be seen in \autoref{fig:Meanplot_seasonal}. From these plots, it is clear that the concentration during the summer for both Vavihill and Malmö does not indicate an increase nor high levels of PM\textsubscript{2.5}. A slight increase can be seen in the case of spring for both locations. A larger increase can be seen during the autumn, where high levels of PM\textsubscript{2.5} can be observed towards the end of the period. The winter in Vavihill indicates an increase in the PM\textsubscript{2.5} concentrations, although the standard deviation indicates highly dispersed data. Although the $\tau$-value during the winter in Malmö is relatively low, Sen's slope indicate a stronger increase. From the graph one can see an increase in PM\textsubscript{2.5} concentrations, although the levels seem to lower towards the end of the period.

    \caption{These plots show how PM\textsubscript{2.5} concentrations change in Vavihill and Malmö for different seasons. It is important to note that 21.1\% of the blocking events occurred during the winter, 27.4\% during the spring, 24.2\% during the summer and 27.4\% during the autumn. In the case of Malmö, It is important to note that 24.0\% of the blocking events occurred during the winter, 34.0\% during the spring, 18.0\% during the summer and 24.0\% during the autumn. Note that a minimum number of datasets was still put to 8.}

\subsubsection{The evolution of \texorpdfstring{PM\textsubscript{2.5}}{PM2.5} depending on strength of high-pressure blocking events}



The increase in PM\textsubscript{2.5} concentrations depending on the strength of the high-pressure blocking event can be seen in \autoref{fig:Meanplot_pressure}. From the plots, we can observe similar behaviour in the two locations. In the case of weaker high-pressure blocking events no clear monotonic increase nor highly elevated levels of Pm\textsubscript{2.5} can be seen. In the case of medium strong high-pressure blocking events we see a stronger increase in the case of Vavihill and weaker in Malmö from the $\tau$-value and Sen's slope value. However when observing both plots one can see an increase for both plots around day 9. In the case of stronger high-pressure blocking events we see a strong increase in the case for Malmö, and not as clear increase in the case of Vavihill. However when viewing the plots one can observe that the levels of PM\textsubscript{2.5} in the case of Vavihill exceed the normal range towards the end of the period. In the case of Malmö we can see a very strong increase towards the ned, where we reach the EU annal mean limit. 

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Meanplot_pressure.pdf}
    \caption{These plots show how PM\textsubscript{2.5} concentrations change in Vavihill and Malmö for different pressure strengths for high-pressure blocking events. In the case of Vavihill, It is important to note that 20.5\% of the blocking events occurred with a mean pressure below 1020 hPa 44.9\% occurred between 1020 and 1025 hPa and 34.6\% occurred with a mean pressure over 1025hPa. In the cas of Malmö, it is important to note that 17.0\% of the blocking events occurred with a mean pressure below 1020 hPa 48.5\% occurred between 1020 and 1025 hPa and 34.5\% occurred with a mean pressure over 1025hPa. Note that a minimum number of datasets was even here put to 8.}

\subsection{Overall analysis of periods of high concentrations of \texorpdfstring{PM\textsubscript{2.5}}{PM2.5}}

From the plots above it is clear that the high elevations of PM\textsubscript{2.5} occur after 9 to 13 days. 



\subsection{The frequency of high pressure blocking events}
The last task was to determine whether high-pressure blocking events have become more common. When looking at the number of high-pressure blocking events per year, no significant change in frequency could be seen (see \autoref{fig:number_of_blockings}). Since the highest levels of PM\textsubscript{2.5} occurred toward the end of the events (see \autoref{fig:Meanplot_Comparison}, \autoref{fig:Meanplot_wind}, \autoref{fig:Meanplot_seasonal}, and \autoref{fig:Meanplot_pressure}), the frequency of longer high-pressure blocking events was also examined. However, no increase could be observed in any of the cases. More interestingly a small decrease can be observed from the $\tau$-values and the Sen's slope values. However one must note that the p-values are much larger here than before, indicating towards a more random system. 

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/BlockingsPerYear.pdf}
    \caption{fig: This plots shows the change in frequency of high-pressure blocking events. The plots also indicates the change in events longer than 7 and 10 days. }
    \label{fig:number_of_blockings}
\end{figure}

In \autoref{fig:Number_of_Blocking_Days_Per_Year}, the number of days under high-pressure blocking events per year can be seen. Here, the total, seasonal, and pressure strength dependence can be observed. The reason for not including the directional dependence is that this was not available from the data. However, these plots show no increase in the number of days under high-pressure blocking events. Even here a slight increase can be seen in most plots, especially the total blocking days per year (h).
