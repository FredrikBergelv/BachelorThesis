Title: Analysis of extreme temperature events in Central Europe related to high pressure blocking situations in 2001–2011 
Authors: Magdalena Porebska* and Malgorzata Zdunek
Link: https://repo.pw.edu.pl/info/article/WUTa49adf041eaf450098b727560cb5dbe8
Comments:
    • “Over Europe, there are 10.6 blocking events per year which on average last for about 9 days and span over 29 degrees of longitude.”
    • A high pressure blocking was found as:
        ◦ A zonal (blocking) index is calculated using the meridional component of the 500 hPa geopotential gradient

Title: Impact of “blocking” structure in the troposphere on the wintertime persistent heavy air pollution in northern China
Authors: Wenyue Cai et. al. 
Comments:
    • 62.5 percent of all extreme pollutions events in China coincided with high pressure blocking periods of a period of >6 days.
    • High pressure blocking events accumulated pollution (blocking periods prohibit diffusion)

Title: The impact of atmospheric blocking on the compounding effect of ozone pollution and temperature: a copula-based approach
Authors: Noelia Otero, Oscar E. Jurado, Tim Butler, and Henning W. Rust
Link: https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/22/1905/2022/#bib1.bibx3
Comments:
    • “atmospheric blocking is a high-impact, large-scale phenomenon at mid-high latitudes that has been associated with temperature extremes”
    • “copula-based method to model the dependence between the two variables”
    • “Our results point out the strong influence of atmospheric blocking on the compounding effect of ozone and temperature events, suggesting that blocks might be considered a relevant predicting factor when assessing the risks of ozone-heat-related health effects”
    • Blocking must be 4 days, cover a certain area for 2 days, together with blocking index (BI), BI=1 is blocking, BI=0 is not
    • This article is a bit more focused on temperature
    • “The present study has assessed the influence of atmospheric blocking on the dependence between daily maximum of 8 h average ozone  and daily maximum temperature  “

Title: Concentration of PM2,5 in the surface layer of the Krasnoyarsk atmosphere during the winter anticyclone
Authors: Zavoruev, VV and Zavorueva, EN 
Link: https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000527367300163
Comments:
    • With the help of CityAir air monitoring station, the assessment of pollution of the surface layer of the atmosphere with anticyclones was carried out. It is shown that the concentration of PM2,5 increases in the air environment of the city of Krasnoyarsk with anticyclones. The highest concentration of PM2,5 was observed at the Vetluzhanka post. It is located below all other posts relative to sea level. Among the stations located on the same level the greatest pollution was observed at the Pokrovka station which is located in the central part of the city. The least air pollution with anticyclone is observed near the Yenisei River.
