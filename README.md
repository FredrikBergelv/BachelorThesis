# Bachelor Thesis: Analysis of PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ Concentration During High-Pressure Blocking Events

This repository contains all scripts, data, and the LaTeX source code for my Bachelor thesis in environmental analysis. The work investigates the relationship between PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ concentrations and high-pressure blocking events using data from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) and air quality measurements from both urban and rural sites in Sk√•ne County, Sweden.

## üìÑ Thesis Introduction

It is common knowledge that Earth‚Äôs increasing temperature has many side effects. One such effect is the increase in frequency of extreme weather phenomena [2]. One such phenomenon, which lacks extensive research, is high-pressure blocking events. High-pressure blocking events is an anticyclone that covers an area for a prolonged period of time and often blocks other types of weather, hence the name. This results in clearer weather and more extreme temperatures [3]. However, an anticyclone is also associated with lower air movement and wind, causing the air to remain stagnant. This can lead to an accumulation of aerosols such as PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ in the region [4].

To investigate the relationship between PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ and high-pressure blocking, one must analyse periods of high-pressure blocking and examine the concentration of PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ during these periods. The goal of this thesis is to analyse the concentration of PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ during periods of high-pressure blocking by examining data from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) and PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ data from rural (Vavihill, Sval√∂v Sk√•ne county) and urban (Malm√∂, Sk√•ne county) areas.
